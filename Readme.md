# Project : Keyless
This script library has NO KEYSYSTEMS.
we hate keysystem for script right? this makes script **WORSE**.
So, i decided to make a script without key.

------

Here's scripts!
> Patched or broken script will not show up.

## Voxel Sandbox
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nonescripter-rblx/Roblox/refs/heads/main/VoxelSandbox.lua",true))()
```

## Secret Staycation
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nonescripter-rblx/Roblox/refs/heads/main/SecretStaycation",true))()
```

> if you skid my script, i will **obfuscate** it. Which is hard to run on bad executor.
> so, please don't skid it.
